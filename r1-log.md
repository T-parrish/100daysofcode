# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Taylor Parrish

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 21st, 2018

### R1D1 
Currently house-sitting for two bengal kittens in Singapore, finished the amazing React web dev class from @andrew_j_mead, made some progress on my React + Node portfolio / blog app.


### R1D2
Tried to build a typewriter React Component from scratch, failed repeatedly. Gained a new appreciation for the React wizards out there who build and maintain libraries like Typist. Next up, diving into ReactCSSTransitionGroup

### R1D3
Made some good progress on building portfolio project components in #React and Knocked out some algorithms from @LeetCode. Feels good to mess around with #Python again, it's been way too long 🐍  #100DaysOfCode 

### R1D4 
Spent an afternoon poking and prodding this vanilla #React card slider component. So far, not having any luck with animating on state change. Maybe this is the wrong way to approach it, tips anybody? 🙏 #100daysofcode
