# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Taylor Parrish

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 21st, 2018

### R1D1 
Currently house-sitting for two bengal kittens in Singapore, finished the amazing React web dev class from @andrew_j_mead, made some progress on my React + Node portfolio / blog app.


### R1D2
Tried to build a typewriter React Component from scratch, failed repeatedly. Gained a new appreciation for the React wizards out there who build and maintain libraries like Typist. Next up, diving into ReactCSSTransitionGroup

### R1D3
Made some good progress on building portfolio project components in #React and Knocked out some algorithms from @LeetCode. Feels good to mess around with #Python again, it's been way too long 🐍  #100DaysOfCode 

### R1D4 
Spent an afternoon poking and prodding this vanilla #React card slider component. So far, not having any luck with animating on state change. Maybe this is the wrong way to approach it, tips anybody? 🙏 #100daysofcode

### R1D5
Ran into some issues with ReactCSSTransitionGroup today... finally realized I'd installed the wrong library (CSSTransitionGroup) for the syntax I was using 😅 After that, got things to animate nicely... but only in one direction 😑 #SmallWins #100DaysOfCode 

### R1D6
Built a nifty animated tile background component today. Needs a little bit of work to automate tile count and tile height, but it's a good start. #100daysofcode

### R1D7
👾 R1D7 - Finished #TheExpanse, updated / optimized my generative tile background component, built the skeleton for my blog and blog dashboard, started packing for the next adventure: Italy! #100daysofcode

### R1D8
🐢 R1D8 - Took a break from React and refactored Express for MongoDB! Cooked up a few routes for blog posts and user creation, bumped the @postmanclient anthem, and loaded up my backpack. Tomorrow, Italy!

### R1D9
24 hours of travel later, made it to Milan. Didn't get internet until the next day, but was able to code for a couple hours on the plan ride over. Progress was slow without being able to ask questions to the internet, but still learned a couple neat things

### R1D10
Spent a good portion of today exploring Milan and recovering from the insane travel day yesterday. Managed to crank out a solid hour of algorithms from leetcode, plan to iron out Authentication for my app over this next week

### R1D11
It's tough to make progress on a project in such a limited window of time. I definitely find that spending 2-3 uninterrupted hours on a project is ideal.

### R1D12
Progress is slow without stable / reliable internet, but I'm pleased with myself for waking up extra early and making sure that I can set aside between 1-2 hours for coding each morning before heading out on adventures.

### R1D13 
🐙 After a couple days exploring Cinque Terre without access to internet, I'm reminded how much I take simple resources like Google and Stack Overflow for granted. Problems that would usually take 10-15 minutes suddenly take 30-45... if I'm really on it 😂 #100daysofcode

### R1D14
☕️️️ Brushed up on Bcrypt, Learned a bunch about Passport and JWT authentication. Big ups to @traversymedia for top-notch lessons and tutorials - definitely my favorite teacher along with @andrew_j_mead for Node and React content. #100DaysOfCode

### R1D15
🍕 Last day in Florence today. Found out that most museums are closed on Mondays, so we explored until the thunderstorm hit. After that -> @Deliveroo pizza, a bottle of wine, and finished routing + validation for this MERN project. Tomorrow, Venice! #100DaysOfCode

### R1D16
🎶 Took some time to practice Linked Lists with @LeetCode. Still a little rough around the edges, but learned a neat trick add or delete nodes with O(n) space and O(1) time complexity! #100DaysOfCode 

### R1D17
🚢 Ran through two full batteries shooting around Venice today. Got to play with the new 10 stop ND filter and test-drive a 70-200mm f/2.8 lens 😍 Wrapping a long day with some algorithm practice / studying - still on target for SF job hunt in September! #100daysofcode

### R1D18
📷 Learned iterative, recursive, and stack-based methods of manipulating / interacting with Linked Lists. Ate cuttlefish pasta with cuttlefish ink sauce. Did a photoshoot for a hotel in Venice. What a day. 😵😴 #100daysofcode

### R1D19
💥Finished & refactored my Node API routes then spent a couple hours being blown away by the @keyframers. What these wizards can accomplish with nothing but CSS is mind blowing / inspiring. #100daysofcode 

### R1D20
💢 Internet at the latest hotel is questionable at best. Made use of my time by doing some work on a couple music projects and organizing my sample library. I was able to start doing some work / learning about binary trees today, though. Any progress is good progress I suppose 😜.

### R1D21
🍣 Built a handful of components, started rigging the front end to the back end using Axios, upgraded productivity with Emmet and es7 snippets, customized VScode a bit more to optimize for my workflow.
