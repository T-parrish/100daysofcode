# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Taylor Parrish

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 21st, 2018

### R1D1 
Currently house-sitting for two bengal kittens in Singapore, finished the amazing React web dev class from @andrew_j_mead, made some progress on my React + Node portfolio / blog app.


### R1D2
Tried to build a typewriter React Component from scratch, failed repeatedly. Gained a new appreciation for the React wizards out there who build and maintain libraries like Typist. Next up, diving into ReactCSSTransitionGroup

### R1D3
Knocked out some algorithms from leetcode, made some good progress on the project section of my portfolio. Feels good to mess around with Python again, it's been way too long :)
