# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Taylor Parrish

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 21st, 2018

### R1D1 
Currently house-sitting for two bengal kittens in Singapore, finished the amazing React web dev class from @andrew_j_mead, made some progress on my React + Node portfolio / blog app.


### R1D2
Tried to build a typewriter React Component from scratch, failed repeatedly. Gained a new appreciation for the React wizards out there who build and maintain libraries like Typist. Next up, diving into ReactCSSTransitionGroup

### R1D3
Made some good progress on building portfolio project components in #React and Knocked out some algorithms from @LeetCode. Feels good to mess around with #Python again, it's been way too long üêç  #100DaysOfCode 

### R1D4 
Spent an afternoon poking and prodding this vanilla #React card slider component. So far, not having any luck with animating on state change. Maybe this is the wrong way to approach it, tips anybody? üôè #100daysofcode

### R1D5
Ran into some issues with ReactCSSTransitionGroup today... finally realized I'd installed the wrong library (CSSTransitionGroup) for the syntax I was using üòÖ After that, got things to animate nicely... but only in one direction üòë #SmallWins #100DaysOfCode 

### R1D6
Built a nifty animated tile background component today. Needs a little bit of work to automate tile count and tile height, but it's a good start. #100daysofcode

### R1D7
üëæ R1D7 - Finished #TheExpanse, updated / optimized my generative tile background component, built the skeleton for my blog and blog dashboard, started packing for the next adventure: Italy! #100daysofcode

### R1D8
üê¢ R1D8 - Took a break from React and refactored Express for MongoDB! Cooked up a few routes for blog posts and user creation, bumped the @postmanclient anthem, and loaded up my backpack. Tomorrow, Italy!

### R1D9
24 hours of travel later, made it to Milan. Didn't get internet until the next day, but was able to code for a couple hours on the plan ride over. Progress was slow without being able to ask questions to the internet, but still learned a couple neat things

### R1D10
Spent a good portion of today exploring Milan and recovering from the insane travel day yesterday. Managed to crank out a solid hour of algorithms from leetcode, plan to iron out Authentication for my app over this next week

### R1D11
It's tough to make progress on a project in such a limited window of time. I definitely find that spending 2-3 uninterrupted hours on a project is ideal.

### R1D12
Progress is slow without stable / reliable internet, but I'm pleased with myself for waking up extra early and making sure that I can set aside between 1-2 hours for coding each morning before heading out on adventures.
