# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Currently house-sitting for two bengal kittens in Singapore
finished the amazing React web dev class from @andrew_j_mead, made some progress on my React + Node portfolio / blog app

**Thoughts:** 
Spent a good amount of time messing around with the 'wave' background effect, still not completely happy with it. Might want to try automating the opacity, reducing the number of waves, making the ovals even bigger, and anchoring the ovals further off-screen. 

I'm also not completely satisfied with the header at this moment: after the elements break down into a centered column I believe it takes up a bit too much of the screen's real estate and messes with the page flow on smaller / mobile devices. I may just break the nav / social icons into a button for modal navigation somewhat like bootstrap, but this remains to be seen.

Aside from that, I have a decent idea of how I want the portfolio to look / function. Tomorrow I'll spend some time building out the portfolio component and learning about page transition animations to solidify my portfolio flow.

### Day 1: May 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on the portfolio some more, Fixed up some of the main page styling, added some animations, and integrated the Typist library. 

**Thoughts:** 
I spent a good deal of time trying to write a custom typewriter-esque React Component, pulling from a bunch of different examples I found on Github. After several failed attempts, I decided it would be a better use of my time to build off of a library. In the end, I chose Typist and integrated it into my homepage.

All said and done, I didn't get as much accomplished today as I had hoped. However, I did learn a good deal about some of React's limitations.

In preparation for the upcoming job hunt, I'll start to work some leetcode / hackerrank exercises into my daily programming mix.

### Day 2: May 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Started studying via LeetCode, did a couple algorithms and did some work towards optimizing them / understanding why certain patters are more efficient than others. Also, feels good to brush back up on Python - really missed it with all the Javascript these days.

Put some work into the portfolio project section of my portfolio app. managed to get things up and running with some custom project cards. Styling isn't quite there yet, but it's good enough to keep moving along. Next thing I need to figure out is how to render the cards to screen responsively without the current sizing issues.

**Thoughts:** 
Good progress today. Knocked out a lot with the projects section and did some good studying for algorithms.

### Day 3: May 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
More algorithms from leetcode, feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it again. Most importantly, learned some nifty use cases and implementations for XOR gates and hash-tables.

Progress was slow on the portfolio app today, managed to create a 'carousel' of sorts for the project cards. However, I keep running into walls when it comes to animating the transitions. 

**Thoughts:** 
Trouble sleeping the night before left me feeling a bit foggy today. Progress was slow, but at least I'm having a blast just poking and prodding React; great way to learn about its limitations and effective design patterns. Working with React is a total joy so far, can't wait to figure out how to animate components dynamically.

### Day 4: May25 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
More algorithms, trying to learn multiple ways of solving each problem while paying attention to time / space complexity. Found a problem that I was able to brute-force, but struggling to understand the hash-table implementation. Tradeoff between time / space between the two, definitely important to understand both. Will come back to this in the future.

Finally managed to implement ReactCSSTransitions - discovered I was using the wrong library for a portion of time. (Doh!) After correctly setting it up, managed to get the animations to work... but only in one direction. Progress!

**Thoughts:** 
Good progress on algorithms, Python is coming back to me much faster than I expected. Had some trouble on a hash-table implementation for solving an an array addition problem, but I was able to write a brute-force solution quite easily. 

For React, gaining a more intuitive feel for how state and props can be manimpulated and passed around. Was really stoked to implement ReactCSSTransitionGroup, but also a bit bummed that it currently only animates to one direction. Small wins!

### Day 5: May 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Learned how to execute functions and update state repeatedly with a specific time-frame. Used this to build a little background component out of colored tiles that randomly update color every ~500ms.

**Thoughts:** 
Learned some new tricks today, built a nifty component and learned some stuff I'll be applying to other portions of the app. Next, I want to figure out how to properly cover the background with repeating tiles by grabbing the window size before the component mounts and using that to math the height of the tiles. After that, I want to experiment with using ReactCSSTransitionGroup to add a little animation each time the tiles are updated.

### Day 6: May 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Really productive day, updated the boxy component to now generate boxes that fit the screen perfectly every time. Secret sauce was to grab the window size when the component mounts and push it into the component's state. After that, I divided the window height by how many rows I wanted and pushed that down into the box props for styling. Learned a good bit about component lifecycle methods during all this.

Also got started on the blog portion of the portfolio, built the scaffolding and a bare-bones form component that I plan to dial up and put behind an authenticated route so I can create blog posts and push em to a database from my own dashboard. But that's for another day.

**Thoughts:** 
Got a lot done today, which is good because I'll be heading off to Italy this coming Tuesday for a bunch of adventures. #100daysofcode is about to go into hard mode, but that just makes me want to push harder :)
