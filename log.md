# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
Currently house-sitting for two bengal kittens in Singapore
finished the amazing React web dev class from @andrew_j_mead, made some progress on my React + Node portfolio / blog app

**Thoughts:** 
Spent a good amount of time messing around with the 'wave' background effect, still not completely happy with it. Might want to try automating the opacity, reducing the number of waves, making the ovals even bigger, and anchoring the ovals further off-screen. 

I'm also not completely satisfied with the header at this moment: after the elements break down into a centered column I believe it takes up a bit too much of the screen's real estate and messes with the page flow on smaller / mobile devices. I may just break the nav / social icons into a button for modal navigation somewhat like bootstrap, but this remains to be seen.

Aside from that, I have a decent idea of how I want the portfolio to look / function. Tomorrow I'll spend some time building out the portfolio component and learning about page transition animations to solidify my portfolio flow.
